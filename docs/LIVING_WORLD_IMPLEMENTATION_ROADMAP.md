# Sanguine Scribe: Living World Implementation Roadmap (V8 - Hierarchical Model)

**Vision:** To execute a methodical, test-driven migration to a **Hierarchical World Model**. This roadmap details the establishment of a rich world ontology (The Atlas), the integration of an AI-driven planning system (The Blueprint), the development of tactical and operational agents (The Puppet), and the creation of a strategic, autonomous narrative system (The Autonomic System), with security and testability as foundational pillars.

## üéÆ **Flexibility & Adaptability Notice**

**IMPORTANT:** The Living World system is designed to be **modular and optional**. While our comprehensive integration tests exercise ALL components, real-world usage should be flexible:

### **Use Case Examples:**
1. **Full Living World Mode** (Default for text-based roleplay)
   - All agents active: Strategic ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Operational
   - Full ECS management, chronicle creation, lorebook updates
   - Complete narrative analysis and world state tracking
   - Best for: Pure text-based roleplay, world simulation

2. **Game Engine Integration Mode**
   - Disable ECS updates (game engine manages world state)
   - Keep narrative analysis for dialogue enrichment
   - Disable spatial tracking (game handles positioning)
   - Best for: Unity/Unreal/Godot integrations

3. **Lightweight Character Mode**
   - Disable Strategic & Tactical agents
   - No world state tracking or chronicle creation
   - Pure character dialogue generation
   - Best for: Simple character interactions, intimate scenarios

4. **Hybrid Modes**
   - Pick and choose components based on needs
   - Enable/disable via configuration flags
   - Mix game engine state with AI narrative enrichment

### **Configuration Approach:**
```yaml
living_world:
  agents:
    strategic: false    # Disable for simple scenarios
    tactical: true      # Keep for context enrichment
    perception: false   # Disable if game provides state
  
  tools:
    ecs_updates: false  # Game engine handles entities
    chronicle: true     # Keep narrative history
    lorebook: false     # Not needed for all use cases
    
  narrative:
    significance_analysis: true  # Lightweight but valuable
    entity_resolution: false     # Game provides entities
```

**Design Principle:** Every component should be independently toggleable without breaking the system. The end user decides which parts of the Living World to activate based on their specific needs.

## üìã **Definition of Done**

**Task Completion Criteria:** A task is considered complete ONLY when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **‚úÖ Code Compiles Successfully**

- Tests pass but OWASP security requirements are not met
- Security tests are not implemented
- Performance significantly degrades
- Error handling is inadequate
- Documentation is missing

## üîç **Current State Assessment & Gap Analysis**

**Foundation Viability: HIGH (8.5/10)** - The existing codebase provides excellent building blocks for the hierarchical agent framework.

### **‚úÖ Existing Strong Foundations**
- **ECS Architecture**: Robust entity-component system with sophisticated spatial hierarchies (`SpatialComponent`, container/containable relationships)
- **Entity Resolution**: Multi-stage `EntityResolutionTool` with AI-powered narrative context extraction
- **Security**: Excellent per-user encryption architecture with `SessionDek` and comprehensive access controls
- **World Modeling**: Chronicle-to-ECS translation, comprehensive world state snapshots, and causal relationship tracking
- **Tool Infrastructure**: Flexible `ScribeTool` registry and `NarrativeAgentRunner` orchestration framework

### **üî¥ Critical Gaps Identified**
- **Missing Hierarchical Agents**: No `StrategicAgent`, `TacticalAgent`, or `PreResponseAgent`/`PostResponseAgent` classes exist
- **No Validated Planning**: The system lacks a dedicated planning-and-validation loop; agentic actions are generated without being explicitly validated against ECS ground truth before execution.
- **Missing Pre-Response Pipeline**: Agents currently run post-chat; no pre-response enrichment integration
- **No Agent Security Framework**: Security controls need extension to new agent hierarchy

### **üü° Partial Implementations**
- **Planning Capabilities**: Sophisticated `QueryStrategyPlanner` and action planning exist but lack formal verification
- **Agent Orchestration**: `AgenticOrchestrator` and `NarrativeAgentRunner` provide orchestration patterns but not hierarchical agent communication
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Components exist but need `ParentLink` and `Salience` tier implementations

## üìã **Implementation Phases & Risk Assessment**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Critical Flash integration refactoring and ECS foundation completion
- **Epics:** 0 (World Ontology), 1 (Foundational Refactoring with Flash Integration), 2 (Tactical Toolkit)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - extensive refactoring of AI integration patterns across 8+ services
- **Success Criteria:** All hardcoded AI calls replaced with Flash abstractions, existing functionality preserved with enhanced ECS capabilities

### **Phase 2: Proof of Concept (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Implement basic hierarchical agents without formal planning
- **Epics:** 4 (Agent Implementation - Basic version)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - architectural changes to chat service integration
- **Success Criteria:** Basic `TacticalAgent` enriching chat prompts with world state

### **Phase 3: LLM Planning & Validation (6-8 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Add AI-driven planning with symbolic validation ("Symbolic Firewall")
- **Epics:** 3 (Planning Cortex)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - robust implementation of PlanValidator service required
- **Success Criteria:** LLM-generated plans validated against ECS ground truth before execution

### **Phase 4: Full Hierarchy (8-10 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Complete the three-layer agent system
- **Epics:** 5 (Strategic Layer & Autonomic Loop)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - AI capability requirements for strategic planning
- **Success Criteria:** Full Strategic ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Operational pipeline with autonomous re-planning

### **Phase 5: System Hardening (2-3 weeks) - üü¢ LOW RISK**
**Focus:** Security validation and performance optimization
- **Epics:** 6 (Full System Validation)
- **Risk Level:** Low - builds on existing security and testing infrastructure
- **Success Criteria:** Production-ready system with comprehensive security audit

### **üö® High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention**
1. **üî¥ Comprehensive Flash Integration**: 8+ services with hardcoded AI calls need systematic refactoring without breaking existing functionality - **This is the bedrock of the entire system**
2. **EnrichedContext Schema Design**: The JSON schema is the formal API between symbolic and neural layers - must be optimized for token efficiency and semantic richness
3. **"Symbolic Firewall" Implementation**: The `PlanValidator` service must successfully prevent the execution of logically impossible or invalid actions proposed by the LLM, grounding the AI's creativity in the ECS's rules.
4. **Prompt Template Architecture**: Agent-specific templates must produce consistent, parseable outputs while maintaining narrative quality
5. **Performance & Cost Optimization**: Hierarchical pipeline must minimize API calls and token usage while maximizing context relevance

## üß† Epic 3: The Planning & Reasoning Cortex (The "Blueprint") - üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Goal:** To create the "Blueprint" for the narrative by implementing an **LLM-as-a-Planner**. This system uses a sophisticated, AI-driven prompt construction process to generate a sequence of actions as a structured JSON object. This plan is then rigorously validated against the ECS ground truth by a "Symbolic Firewall" before execution, ensuring causal consistency without the rigidity of an external formal planning engine.

**Current State:** üü° **80% Complete** - Action Schema, Planning Types, LLM-based Planning Service, Plan Validator (Symbolic Firewall), and ECS State Reconciliation & Intelligent Plan Repair fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage and Flash integration. Task 3.5 (Integration Tests) pending.

**Risk Assessment:** üü° **MEDIUM RISK** - The core challenge is not integration with an external framework, but the robust implementation of the `PlanValidator` service. This service is the critical "Symbolic Firewall" that must correctly interpret the AI's plan and prevent any invalid actions from being executed.

### üöÄ **Caching Strategy for Token Optimization**

**Objective:** Minimize redundant AI queries and token usage through intelligent caching of plans, validations, and entity states across conversation turns.

#### **Multi-Layer Caching Architecture**

1. **üîµ Plan Cache** - Cache validated plans for similar goals
   - **Key Structure:** `plan:{user_hash}:{goal_hash}:{world_state_hash}`
   - **TTL:** 5 minutes or until world state change
   - **Invalidation:** On entity updates affecting plan preconditions
   - **Storage:** Redis with JSON serialization

2. **üü¢ Context Window Cache** - Keep recent entity states in memory
   - **Structure:** HashMap of recently accessed entities (last 2-3 turns)
   - **Integration:** Embedded in `EnrichedContext.context_cache`
   - **Benefits:** Avoid re-querying entities just accessed
   - **TTL:** Duration of conversation session

3. **üü° Validation Result Cache** - Cache plan validation outcomes
   - **Key Structure:** `validation:{plan_hash}:{world_state_hash}:{user_hash}`
   - **TTL:** 3 minutes (shorter than plan cache)
   - **Purpose:** Skip re-validation of identical plans

#### **Implementation Details**

```rust
// EnrichedContext with integrated caching
pub struct EnrichedContext {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    /// Context cache for avoiding repeated queries
    pub context_cache: Option<ContextCache>,
}

pub struct ContextCache {
    /// Entities accessed in recent turns
    pub recent_entities: HashMap<Uuid, CachedEntityState>,
    /// Recently validated plans that might be reusable
    pub recent_plans: Vec<(String, ValidatedPlan)>,
    /// Cache timestamp for TTL management
    pub cache_timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

#### **Cache Integration Points**

- **PlanningService:** Check plan cache before AI generation
- **PlanValidator:** Cache validation results for reuse
- **TacticalAgent:** Maintain context cache across turns
- **EcsEntityManager:** Leverage existing Redis entity cache

#### **Handling Repetitive Requests**

**Scenario:** User asks "What's in the cantina?" twice in consecutive turns.

**Without Caching:**
- Turn 1: AI queries entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response (300+ tokens)
- Turn 2: AI queries same entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response (300+ tokens)
- **Total:** 600+ tokens wasted on redundant operations

**With Caching:**
- Turn 1: AI queries entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Cache results
- Turn 2: Context cache hit ‚Üí Skip AI planning ‚Üí Use cached validation ‚Üí Response
- **Total:** 300 tokens + minimal overhead (80%+ reduction)

**Implementation Benefits:**
1. **Token Savings:** 70-90% reduction for repetitive queries
2. **Latency Improvement:** Sub-100ms responses for cached scenarios
3. **Cost Optimization:** Significant reduction in API costs
4. **Consistency:** Identical questions get consistent answers

*   **[x] Task 3.1: Define the Action Schema for the LLM Planner** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

    *   **Objective:** Handle cases where the ECS is inconsistent or missing expected state, enabling the planner to intelligently repair world state or adapt plans based on narrative context.
    *   **Problem:** Current Plan Validator rigidly rejects plans based on ECS state, but sometimes the ECS is wrong/incomplete rather than the plan being invalid.
    *   **Examples:**

        *   **Missing Component Creation**: "This character should have a 'Reputation' component based on recent interactions, but it was never created"
        *   **Inconsistent Relationships**: "The narrative established trust between characters, but the ECS relationship doesn't reflect this"
        *   **Temporal Inconsistencies**: "The plan assumes it's nighttime based on narrative context, but ECS has no time tracking"

            4. [x] Validate repair plan + original plan as combined sequence
            5. [x] Return `RepairableInvalidPlan` with both original and repair actions
        *   [x] **New Return Types**:
            *   [x] `ValidPlan`: Plan passes validation as-is
            *   [x] `InvalidPlan`: Plan genuinely invalid, cannot be repaired
            *   [x] `RepairableInvalidPlan`: Plan invalid but ECS inconsistency detected, includes repair actions
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.4.4: Comprehensive Testing** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
        *   [x] **Functional Tests**: Test all repair scenarios (missing movement, components, relationships, temporal) - 11 functional tests
        *   [x] **Confidence Testing**: Verify the system correctly distinguishes ECS errors from invalid plans
        *   [x] **Safety Testing**: Ensure repairs don't create new inconsistencies or break existing state

    *   **[x] Subtask 3.4.5: Example Scenario Implementation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
        *   [x] **Scenario**: User says "Sol greets Borga warmly" but ECS shows no relationship between them
        *   [x] **Current Behavior**: Plan to update relationship fails validation (no existing relationship)
        *   [x] **New Behavior**: 
            1. [x] Detect missing relationship based on narrative context ("greets warmly" implies familiarity)
            2. [x] Generate repair action: `create_relationship(Sol, Borga, "acquaintance", trust=0.6)`
            3. [x] Return combined plan: [repair_action, original_relationship_update]
            4. [x] Log repair for user awareness: "Created missing relationship based on narrative context"

*   **[x] Task 3.5: Planning and Validation Integration Tests** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
    *   **Objective:** Verify that the entire planning and validation loop works correctly.
    *   **File:** `backend/tests/planning_service_integration_tests.rs`
    *   **Current State:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Integration test infrastructure implemented and validated
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.5.1: Write a "Valid Plan" Test:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

        3.  [x] Mock the AI call in `PlanningService` to return a correct, hardcoded JSON plan: `{"actions": [{"name": "move_entity", "parameters": ["Sol", "Cantina"]}]}`.
        4.  [x] Call the `PlanningService`, then pass its output to the `PlanValidatorService`.
        5.  [x] Assert that the plan is validated successfully.
    *   **üìã NOTE:** Subtasks 3.5.2-3.5.4 moved to Epic 4 Dependencies - require repair system functionality

   - Test now shows successful entity persistence:
     - Exchange 2: 9 entities persisted
     - Exchange 3: 5 entities persisted  
     - Exchange 4: 5 entities persisted
     - Exchange 5: 4 entities persisted
   - Total: 23 entity persistence operations across 5 exchanges

## üß† **Epic 8: Orchestrator-Driven Intelligent Agent System**

**Status:** üÜï **Planning Phase** - Evolve from a rigid linear pipeline to a durable, stateful reasoning engine with true intelligence.

**Context:** Epic 7 delivered a high-performance, dual-path architecture. However, the background pipeline remains a rigid, linear process (`Perception` ‚Üí `Strategic` ‚Üí `Tactical`). This limits the system's intelligence, as it cannot dynamically react to findings, use tools in a flexible sequence, or manage complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. This epic replaces the linear pipeline with a stateful, durable, and intelligent **Orchestrator Agent** that operates as the "director" of the background world simulation.

**Vision:** To create a robust reasoning engine that combines durability (never lose user interactions), scalability (handle high volumes), and intelligence (true reasoning, prediction, and collaboration). The Orchestrator manages a persistent task queue and coordinates all agents dynamically based on context and needs, while maintaining the Progressive Response Architecture for optimal performance.

**Architecture Overview:**

The system maintains the Progressive Response Architecture from Epic 7, with the Orchestrator enhancing rather than replacing it:

```
First Message in New Chat:
User Message ‚Üí Lightning Agent (minimal cache) ‚Üí Create Task in Queue
                     ‚Üì                                    ‚Üì
            Stream basic response              Orchestrator runs FULL pipeline
                                              (Perception ‚Üí Strategic ‚Üí Tactical)
                                                         ‚Üì
                                              Populate all cache layers & DB

Subsequent Messages (Progressive Response):
User Message ‚Üí Lightning Agent (rich cache) ‚Üí Create Task in Queue
                     ‚Üì                                    ‚Üì
            Stream context-aware response      Orchestrator selective updates
            (benefits from previous               (only what changed)
             Orchestrator enrichment)                     ‚Üì
                                              Update cache layers progressively
```

**Key Integration Points:**
- **First Message:** Orchestrator performs complete world initialization
- **Subsequent Messages:** Lightning Agent leverages Orchestrator-populated caches
- **Cache Layers:** Immediate ‚Üí Enhanced ‚Üí Full (populated by Orchestrator)
- **Intelligent Updates:** Orchestrator only processes changes, not full re-analysis
