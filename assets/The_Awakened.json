Policy shifts include a proposed 17% average budget cut for federal agencies and a significant rollback of environmental regulations. The US Treasury established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, converting 5% of national gold reserves. New trade tariffs of 23% against Canada and 31% against Mexico have triggered retaliatory measures. Immigration enforcement intensified with military deployment to the southern border and mass deportations, reportedly creating labor shortages in agriculture and service sectors. Tax policies favor corporate reductions and extending 2017 tax cuts. US economic growth is projected to slow to 1.6% in 2025 (OECD), with the Federal Reserve maintaining restrictive monetary policy due to persistent inflation (around 3.8%). Congress is reportedly divided (Rep. Senate, Dem. House), leading to reliance on executive actions. Public opinion is highly polarized (e.g., 85% Rep. support vs 12% Dem. for Trump). Administrative priorities include federal agency restructuring (Schedule F). US policy towards Ukraine has reportedly involved reduced aid and diplomatic pressure for territorial compromise, while Middle East policy strongly favors Israeli positions with strengthened Saudi relations.",

The EU economy shows modest improvement, with growth averaging 1.3% in early 2025 and inflation around 3.3%. Energy security has improved post-Russian gas reduction, but at higher costs. Strategic autonomy efforts continue, with average defense spending at 2.1% of GDP (Poland 3.2%). Digital sovereignty is pursued via DSA/DMA implementation. The European Green Deal proceeds, with solar/wind capacity reportedly doubling since 2021 and renewed consideration for nuclear power in some states; a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is active. Migration remains divisive, with Mediterranean states implementing pushback policies.",

China leads global production in renewables, EVs, and some semiconductors. AI capabilities are advancing, particularly in surveillance, with AI-enhanced censorship. Hong Kong's integration is nearly complete (last independent media closed 2024). Tensions with Taiwan persist (military exercises, economic pressure; 3 more countries reportedly switched recognition from Taipei since 2023). The Belt and Road Initiative expanded to 78 countries.
