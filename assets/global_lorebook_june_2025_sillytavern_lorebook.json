      "content": "Donald Trump, inaugurated Jan 20, 2025, for his second term (reportedly after defeating Kamala Harris in 2024), rescinded Biden's AI Executive Order for a deregulatory approach. Policy shifts include a proposed 17% average budget cut for federal agencies and a significant rollback of environmental regulations. The US Treasury established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, converting 5% of national gold reserves. New trade tariffs of 23% against Canada and 31% against Mexico have triggered retaliatory measures. Immigration enforcement intensified with military deployment to the southern border and mass deportations, reportedly creating labor shortages in agriculture and service sectors. Tax policies favor corporate reductions and extending 2017 tax cuts. US economic growth is projected to slow to 1.6% in 2025 (OECD), with the Federal Reserve maintaining restrictive monetary policy due to persistent inflation (around 3.8%). Congress is reportedly divided (Rep. Senate, Dem. House), leading to reliance on executive actions. Public opinion is highly polarized (e.g., 85% Rep. support vs 12% Dem. for Trump). Administrative priorities include federal agency restructuring (Schedule F). US policy towards Ukraine has reportedly involved reduced aid and diplomatic pressure for territorial compromise, while Middle East policy strongly favors Israeli positions with strengthened Saudi relations.",
