- Performance significantly degrades
- Error handling is inadequate
- Documentation is missing

## üîç **Current State Assessment & Gap Analysis**

**Foundation Viability: HIGH (8.5/10)** - The existing codebase provides excellent building blocks for the hierarchical agent framework.

### **‚úÖ Existing Strong Foundations**
- **ECS Architecture**: Robust entity-component system with sophisticated spatial hierarchies (`SpatialComponent`, container/containable relationships)
- **Entity Resolution**: Multi-stage `EntityResolutionTool` with AI-powered narrative context extraction
- **Security**: Excellent per-user encryption architecture with `SessionDek` and comprehensive access controls
- **World Modeling**: Chronicle-to-ECS translation, comprehensive world state snapshots, and causal relationship tracking
- **Tool Infrastructure**: Flexible `ScribeTool` registry and `NarrativeAgentRunner` orchestration framework

### **üî¥ Critical Gaps Identified**
- **Missing Hierarchical Agents**: No `StrategicAgent`, `TacticalAgent`, or `PreResponseAgent`/`PostResponseAgent` classes exist
- **No Formal Planning**: Current system uses LLM-based planning without formal verification (no PDDL/HTN integration)
- **Missing Pre-Response Pipeline**: Agents currently run post-chat; no pre-response enrichment integration
- **No Agent Security Framework**: Security controls need extension to new agent hierarchy

### **üü° Partial Implementations**
- **Planning Capabilities**: Sophisticated `QueryStrategyPlanner` and action planning exist but lack formal verification
- **Agent Orchestration**: `AgenticOrchestrator` and `NarrativeAgentRunner` provide orchestration patterns but not hierarchical agent communication
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Components exist but need `ParentLink` and `Salience` tier implementations

## üìã **Implementation Phases & Risk Assessment**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Critical Flash integration refactoring and ECS foundation completion
- **Epics:** 0 (World Ontology), 1 (Foundational Refactoring with Flash Integration), 2 (Tactical Toolkit)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - extensive refactoring of AI integration patterns across 8+ services
- **Success Criteria:** All hardcoded AI calls replaced with Flash abstractions, existing functionality preserved with enhanced ECS capabilities

### **Phase 2: Proof of Concept (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Implement basic hierarchical agents without formal planning
- **Epics:** 4 (Agent Implementation - Basic version)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - architectural changes to chat service integration
- **Success Criteria:** Basic `TacticalAgent` enriching chat prompts with world state

### **Phase 3: Formal Planning Integration (6-8 weeks) - üî¥ HIGH RISK**
**Focus:** Add symbolic reasoning and formal planning capabilities
- **Epics:** 3 (Planning Cortex)
- **Risk Level:** High - complex integration with external planning frameworks
- **Success Criteria:** PDDL/HTN planner generating verifiable action sequences

### **Phase 4: Full Hierarchy (8-10 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Complete the three-layer agent system
- **Epics:** 5 (Strategic Layer & Autonomic Loop)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - AI capability requirements for strategic planning
- **Success Criteria:** Full Strategic ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Operational pipeline with autonomous re-planning

### **Phase 5: System Hardening (2-3 weeks) - üü¢ LOW RISK**
**Focus:** Security validation and performance optimization
- **Epics:** 6 (Full System Validation)
- **Risk Level:** Low - builds on existing security and testing infrastructure
- **Success Criteria:** Production-ready system with comprehensive security audit

### **üö® High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention**
1. **üî¥ Comprehensive Flash Integration**: 8+ services with hardcoded AI calls need systematic refactoring without breaking existing functionality - **This is the bedrock of the entire system**
2. **EnrichedContext Schema Design**: The JSON schema is the formal API between symbolic and neural layers - must be optimized for token efficiency and semantic richness
3. **"Symbolic Firewall" Implementation**: PDDL planner must successfully prevent logically impossible outputs while preserving narrative creativity
4. **Prompt Template Architecture**: Agent-specific templates must produce consistent, parseable outputs while maintaining narrative quality
5. **Performance & Cost Optimization**: Hierarchical pipeline must minimize API calls and token usage while maximizing context relevance

    *   **[ ] Subtask 0.2.1: Create Scale-Aware Salience Component**
        *   [ ] **`Salience` Component Enum:**
            *   [ ] **`Core`**: Player Characters, major NPCs, key locations (always tracked)
            *   [ ] **`Secondary`**: Supporting characters, important items, notable locations (tracked when relevant)
            *   [ ] **`Flavor`**: Scenery, background details, atmospheric elements (created/destroyed as needed)
        *   [ ] **Scale-Specific Examples:**
            *   [ ] **Galactic Scale**: Core = "Death Star", Secondary = "Imperial Fleet", Flavor = "Background starships"
            *   [ ] **Planetary Scale**: Core = "Tatooine", Secondary = "Mos Eisley", Flavor = "Random moisture farms"

    *   **Current State:** ‚ùå Not implemented - Existing tools are direct wrappers around ECS logic.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 0.3.1: Create AI-Powered Hierarchy Tools**
        *   [ ] **`AnalyzeHierarchyRequestTool`**: Create a new tool that uses Flash-Lite to interpret natural language requests (e.g., "show me the chain of command for this fleet") and translates them into formal queries for `GetEntityHierarchyTool`.
        *   [ ] **`SuggestHierarchyPromotionTool`**: Create a new tool that uses Flash to analyze narrative events and suggest when a hierarchy promotion is logical (e.g., "The characters have discussed the 'Crimson Fleet' extensively. Suggest promoting it to a `Core` salience entity with its own hierarchy.").
    *   **[ ] Subtask 0.3.2: Create AI-Powered Salience Management Tool**
        *   [ ] **`UpdateSalienceTool`**: Create a tool that uses Flash to analyze narrative context from a chat message or event and automatically assign or update an entity's `Salience` tier (`Core`, `Secondary`, `Flavor`).
        *   [ ] **Use Case**: When a background character ("a bartender") is mentioned repeatedly and becomes important to the plot, this tool would automatically promote them from `Flavor` to `Secondary` or `Core`.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 0.3.3: Write AI-Tool Integration Tests**
        *   [ ] Test `AnalyzeHierarchyRequestTool` with various natural language queries.
        *   [ ] Test `SuggestHierarchyPromotionTool` with narrative snippets that imply a promotion is needed.
        *   [ ] Test `UpdateSalienceTool` with before/after narrative contexts to verify correct salience assignment.

*   **[ ] Task 1.1: Analyze and Deconstruct `EntityResolutionTool`**
    *   **Objective:** Map the logic from the existing tool to the new, decoupled toolkit.
    *   **Current State:** ‚úÖ Multi-stage `EntityResolutionTool` exists with sophisticated logic that can be cleanly decomposed
    *   **üî¥ Critical Issue Identified:** The existing tool uses hardcoded system prompts and manual AI client calls instead of Flash/Flash-Lite integration

## üß† Epic 3: The Planning & Reasoning Cortex (The "Blueprint") - üî¥ HIGH RISK

**Goal:** To create the "Blueprint" for the narrative by integrating a formal planner, providing a guarantee of causal consistency.

**Current State:** üü° **5% Complete** - Query planning infrastructure exists but no formal planning engine integration

**Risk Assessment:** üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - Complex integration with external planning frameworks that may not align cleanly with existing ECS architecture

*   **[ ] Task 3.1: Define the PDDL Action Domain**
    *   **Objective:** Translate the agent's toolkit from Epic 2 into a formal language the planner can understand.
    *   **Current State:** ‚ùå No formal planning language integration exists
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Start with simple PDDL domain before attempting complex HTN integration
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.1.1:** Create a `domain.pddl` file in `backend/resources/planning/`.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.1.2:** For each tool in `world_tools.rs` (e.g., `move_entity`), define a corresponding PDDL `(:action ...)` with `:parameters`, `:precondition`, and `:effect`. The predicates in the PDDL file must map directly to ECS components and relationships.

*   **[ ] Task 3.2: Integrate a Unified Planning Framework**
    *   **Objective:** Add a planning engine to the backend services.
    *   **Current State:** ‚ùå No formal planning framework integration
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Research Rust-compatible planning frameworks before implementation
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.2.1:** **RESEARCH PHASE:** Evaluate `AIPlan4EU Unified Planning Framework (UPF)` compatibility with Rust ecosystem. Consider alternatives like `planning-rs` or Python integration.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.2.2:** Create a new `backend/src/services/planning/mod.rs` module and a `PlanningService`.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.2.3:** Implement a `PlanningService::generate_plan` method that takes the current world state (as a structured representation of relevant ECS data) and a goal state, and uses the selected planning framework to generate a plan.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.2.4 (Security - A02):** The `generate_plan` method MUST require a `SessionDek` as an argument to decrypt the necessary world state data for planning. Add tests to confirm it fails without one.

*   **[ ] Task 3.3: Planner Integration Tests**
    *   **Objective:** Verify that the planner can generate a valid plan based on the world state.
    *   **File:** `backend/tests/planning_service_tests.rs` (new)
    *   **Current State:** ‚úÖ Excellent test infrastructure exists with `test_helpers` - can be leveraged for planning tests
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.3.1:** Write a test that:
        1.  [ ] Uses existing `test_helpers` to set up an initial world state in the test DB (e.g., "Sol is in the Chamber").
        2.  [ ] Defines a goal state as a set of predicates (e.g., "Sol is in the Cantina").
        3.  [ ] Calls the `PlanningService`.
        4.  [ ] Asserts that the service returns a non-empty, valid sequence of actions (e.g., `[move_entity("Sol", "Cantina")]`).
    *   **[ ] Subtask 3.3.2 (Security - A01):** Add a test case where the goal involves an entity not owned by the user, and assert that the planner fails to produce a plan, returning a `PermissionDenied` error.

## ü§ñ Epic 4: Implementing the Tactical & Operational Layers (The "Puppet")

**Goal:** Build the agent that executes the planner's blueprint and integrate it into the application's request lifecycle.

*   **[ ] Task 4.1: Test and Implement the `TacticalAgent`**
    *   **File:** `backend/src/services/agentic/tactical_agent.rs` (new, replacing `pre_response_agent.rs`), `backend/tests/agentic/tactical_agent_tests.rs` (new)
    *   **Subtask 4.1.1: Write Reasoning Test First:**
        *   **Objective:** Verify the agent's decision-making process using the new planner.
        *   **Test:** Provide a narrative snippet: "Sol wants to go to the bustling cantina." Assert the agent calls the services in the correct sequence:
            1.  [ ] `PlanningService::generate_plan` with goal "Sol is in cantina".
            2.  [ ] Receives plan `[move_entity("Sol", "cantina")]`.
            3.  [ ] Identifies `move_entity` as the sub-goal to execute.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 4.1.2: Implement Agent Core Logic:**
        *   [ ] **Objective:** Write the agent's main loop and reasoning prompt.
        *   [ ] **Implementation:** Write the `TacticalAgent` struct and the master system prompt that instructs it to: receive a directive, get a plan from the `PlanningService`, and execute the *first step* of that plan by preparing an `EnrichedContext` payload for the `RoleplayAI` (the Operational Layer).
    *   **[ ] Subtask 4.1.3 (Security - A09):** Enhance logging to record the directive received, the full plan generated by the `PlanningCortex`, and the specific sub-goal chosen for execution.

*   **[ ] Task 4.2: Test and Implement Pipeline Integration**
    *   **File:** `backend/src/prompt_builder.rs`, `backend/src/services/chat/chat_service.rs`
    *   **[ ] Subtask 4.2.1: Write Integration Test First:**
        *   [ ] **Objective:** Verify the agent's output correctly enriches the final prompt.
        *   [ ] **Test:** Write a test that simulates a full request to the chat service. Invoke the `TacticalAgent`, capture the `EnrichedContext` it produces, and assert that this context is correctly passed to `prompt_builder.rs` and rendered into the final prompt string under the `<current_world_state>` tag.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 4.2.2: Implement the Integration:**
        *   [ ] **Objective:** Plumb the agent into the chat service.
        *   [ ] **Implementation:** Modify the chat service to call the `TacticalAgent`. Modify `prompt_builder.rs` to accept and render the `EnrichedContext`.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 4.2.3: Formalize the EnrichedContext Schema (CRITICAL)**
        *   [ ] **Define `EnrichedContext` as First-Class API**: Treat the JSON schema as the formal API between symbolic world and neural generation
        *   [ ] **Version the Schema**: Implement versioning to allow schema evolution without breaking changes
        *   [ ] **Document Schema Specification**: Create comprehensive documentation for the `EnrichedContext` structure
        *   [ ] **Implement Schema Validation**: Add runtime validation to ensure `TacticalAgent` produces valid payloads
        *   [ ] **Optimize for Token Efficiency**: Design schema to minimize token usage while maximizing context relevance

## ‚ö° Epic 5: The Strategic Layer & Autonomic Loop (The "Autonomic System")

**Goal:** Develop the high-level "Director" and the parallel "Perception" agent, creating a fully autonomous, self-correcting system.

*   **[ ] Task 5.1: Test and Implement the `PerceptionAgent` (Foresight Engine)**
    *   **Objective:** Create the agent that processes the AI's response in the background, updating the world state for the next turn.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.1.1: Write Tests First:**
        *   [ ] **Unit Test:** Provide a mock AI response and assert the agent correctly identifies entities and state changes using its JERE model/extraction logic.
        *   [ ] **Integration Test:** In the main chat service test, after receiving a mock AI response, assert the `PerceptionAgent` is triggered in a background task (`tokio::spawn`) and correctly updates the database.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.1.2: Implement the `PerceptionAgent` and its asynchronous trigger in `chat_service.rs`.**

*   **[ ] Task 5.2: Implement Dynamic Re-planning**
    *   **Objective:** Enable the `TacticalAgent` to react to unexpected outcomes.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.2.1:** Modify the `TacticalAgent` to store the generated plan in a short-term cache.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.2.2:** On its next invocation, the `TacticalAgent` will first check if the world state (updated by the `PerceptionAgent`) matches the expected outcome of the last executed step.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.2.3:** If the state has deviated, the agent must invalidate the old plan and request a new one from the `PlanningService` based on the new reality.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.2.4:** Write integration tests for deviation scenarios (e.g., a "persuade" action fails) and assert that the agent correctly re-plans.

*   **[ ] Task 5.3: Implement the `StrategicAgent` (The "Director")**
    *   **Objective:** Create the high-level agent for long-term narrative management.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.3.1:** Create a new `StrategicAgent` service. Initially, it can be a simple pass-through that converts user intent into a goal for the `TacticalAgent`.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.3.2:** Develop a system prompt for the `StrategicAgent` that instructs it to analyze the overall chat history and define high-level narrative goals (e.g., "initiate combat," "introduce mystery," "resolve conflict").
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.3.3:** Integrate the `StrategicAgent` into the `chat_service` so it runs before the `TacticalAgent`, providing the initial directive.
    *   **[ ] Subtask 5.3.4: Define Agent-Specific Prompt Templates (CRITICAL)**
        *   [ ] **StrategicAgent Prompt Template**: High-level prompt that receives chat history and world events, asks Gemini to "propose a narrative direction" like 'introduce mystery' or 'escalate conflict'
        *   [ ] **RoleplayAI Prompt Template**: Detailed prompt that receives rich `EnrichedContext` payload from `TacticalAgent` to generate final narrative output
        *   [ ] **Prompt Template Versioning**: Implement versioning system for prompt templates to enable A/B testing and iterative improvement
        *   [ ] **Template Validation**: Add validation to ensure prompt templates produce consistent, parseable outputs
