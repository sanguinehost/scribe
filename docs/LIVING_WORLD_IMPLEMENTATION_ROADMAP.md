# Living World Implementation Roadmap

**Priority:** Critical - Transform from sophisticated chatbot to living world substrate  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for core transformation  
**Goal:** Complete the missing 30-40% to achieve true living world functionality

## Phase 1: Entity Resolution Revolution (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Enhanced Context-Aware Entity Resolution
**File:** `backend/src/services/agentic/enhanced_entity_resolver.rs`

**Problem:** Current entity resolution fails to maintain persistent identity
- AI creates "duplicate" entities instead of recognizing existing ones
- Context-blind resolution leads to entity explosion
- No semantic similarity matching

**Solution:** Multi-stage resolution with deep context understanding
```rust
// Enhanced resolution pipeline
pub struct EnhancedEntityResolver {
    // Step 1: Semantic similarity matching via embeddings
    pub async fn find_semantic_matches() -> Vec<SimilarityMatch>
    
    // Step 2: Enhanced AI prompting with full context
    pub async fn ai_resolve_with_context() -> Vec<AIResolution>
    
    // Step 3: Validation and reconciliation
    pub async fn validate_and_reconcile_decisions() -> Vec<ValidatedResolution>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Semantic similarity matching using vector embeddings
- [ ] Enhanced AI prompts with rich contextual information
- [ ] Validation layer to prevent resolution conflicts
- [ ] Integration with existing EntityResolutionTool

**Definition of Done:** Entity resolution achieves >95% accuracy in matching existing entities across different narrative contexts.

### 1.2 Persistent Identity Tracking
**File:** `backend/src/services/identity_tracker.rs`

**Problem:** No system tracks entity identity across mentions and aliases
- "The Dark Lord" should link to "Vader" which links to "Anakin Skywalker"
- No canonical name resolution
- Aliases aren't properly managed

**Solution:** Persistent identity tracking with alias resolution
```rust
pub struct IdentityTracker {
    // Canonical entity identity with all aliases
    pub async fn register_entity_identity() -> Result<EntityIdentity>
    
    // Resolve any mention to canonical entity
    pub async fn resolve_mention_to_canonical() -> Option<Uuid>
    
    // Track identity evolution over time
    pub async fn update_entity_identity() -> Result<()>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Entity identity registry with canonical names
- [ ] Alias resolution system
- [ ] Identity evolution tracking
- [ ] Integration with chronicle events

**Definition of Done:** All entity mentions consistently resolve to correct canonical entities with proper alias tracking.

## Phase 2: Component Enrichment Pipeline (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Rich Component Extraction from Narrative
**File:** `backend/src/services/component_extractor.rs`

**Problem:** Components are empty shells with no meaningful data
- Health components: `null` or `{}`
- Position components: no spatial information
- Relationships: empty arrays

**Solution:** AI-powered component extraction with validation
```rust
pub struct ComponentExtractor {
    // Extract rich component data from narrative context
    pub async fn extract_components_from_narrative() -> Vec<ComponentData>
    
    // Validate component data for consistency
    pub async fn validate_component_data() -> Result<ValidatedComponents>
    
    // Merge with existing components intelligently
    pub async fn merge_with_existing() -> Result<MergedComponents>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] AI-powered component extraction from narrative text
- [ ] Component validation and consistency checking
- [ ] Intelligent merging with existing component data
- [ ] Support for all component types (Health, Position, Relationships, Inventory)

**Definition of Done:** Components contain rich, meaningful data extracted from narrative context with high accuracy.

### 2.2 Spatial World Model Implementation
**File:** `backend/src/services/spatial_world_manager.rs`

**Problem:** No spatial hierarchy or containment relationships
- Characters don't exist "inside" locations
- Items don't belong to characters or containers
- No spatial queries possible

**Solution:** Full spatial hierarchy with containment relationships
```rust
pub struct SpatialWorldManager {
    // Manage spatial containment hierarchy
    pub async fn update_spatial_containment() -> Result<()>
    
    // Query spatial relationships
    pub async fn query_entities_in_container() -> Vec<EntityQueryResult>
    
    // Track spatial movement and transitions
    pub async fn handle_spatial_transition() -> Result<()>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Spatial containment hierarchy (Universe → Galaxy → Planet → City → Building → Room → Character/Item)
- [ ] Spatial queries ("Who is in the tavern?", "What items does X carry?")
- [ ] Movement tracking and transition validation
- [ ] Integration with Position components

**Definition of Done:** Full spatial hierarchy with efficient queries and realistic containment relationships.

## Phase 3: Consequence Engine (Week 3-4)

### 3.1 Event-Driven State Updates
**File:** `backend/src/services/consequence_engine.rs`

**Problem:** Chronicle events don't update ECS world state
- Combat events don't affect health components
- Item acquisition doesn't update inventory
- Relationship changes don't persist

**Solution:** Automatic ECS updates driven by chronicle events
```rust
pub struct ConsequenceEngine {
    // Process chronicle events to update ECS state
    pub async fn process_event_consequences() -> Result<StateUpdateResult>
    
    // Apply logical consequences to entity components
    pub async fn apply_component_updates() -> Result<()>
    
    // Validate state consistency after updates
    pub async fn validate_world_state() -> Result<ValidationResult>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Chronicle event → ECS state update mapping
- [ ] Automatic component updates based on events
- [ ] State consistency validation
- [ ] Transaction-based updates for atomicity

**Definition of Done:** Chronicle events automatically and correctly update ECS world state with logical consequences.

### 3.2 Causal Relationship Tracking
**File:** `backend/src/services/causal_tracker.rs`

**Problem:** No tracking of cause-effect relationships between events
- Actions don't have persistent consequences
- No causal chains linking events
- World state changes appear random

**Solution:** Comprehensive causal relationship tracking
```rust
pub struct CausalTracker {
    // Track causal chains between events
    pub async fn establish_causal_relationship() -> Result<()>
    
    // Query causal dependencies
    pub async fn get_causal_chain() -> Vec<CausalLink>
    
    // Predict probable consequences
    pub async fn predict_consequences() -> Vec<ProbableConsequence>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Causal chain tracking between events
- [ ] Causal relationship queries
- [ ] Consequence prediction based on causal history
- [ ] Integration with chronicle causality fields

**Definition of Done:** All significant events have traceable causal relationships with logical consequences.

## Phase 4: Emergence Framework (Week 4-5)

### 4.1 Autonomous Entity Behavior
**File:** `backend/src/services/autonomous_behavior.rs`

**Problem:** Entities are passive - no autonomous actions
- NPCs don't act independently between sessions
- No emergent behaviors
- World is static when player absent

**Solution:** Autonomous entity behavior system
```rust
pub struct AutonomousBehavior {
    // Generate autonomous actions for entities
    pub async fn generate_autonomous_actions() -> Vec<AutonomousAction>
    
    // Execute autonomous behaviors
    pub async fn execute_autonomous_behavior() -> Result<()>
    
    // Manage behavior schedules and triggers
    pub async fn manage_behavior_schedule() -> Result<()>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Autonomous action generation based on entity goals
- [ ] Behavior scheduling system
- [ ] Goal-driven NPC actions
- [ ] Integration with existing event system

**Definition of Done:** NPCs take meaningful autonomous actions that advance their goals and affect the world state.

### 4.2 Dynamic World Events
**File:** `backend/src/services/world_event_generator.rs`

**Problem:** World only changes when player acts
- No environmental changes
- No social/political evolution
- World feels static and artificial

**Solution:** Dynamic world event generation
```rust
pub struct WorldEventGenerator {
    // Generate world events based on current state
    pub async fn generate_world_events() -> Vec<WorldEvent>
    
    // Process environmental changes
    pub async fn process_environmental_events() -> Result<()>
    
    // Handle social/political evolution
    pub async fn evolve_social_dynamics() -> Result<()>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Environmental event generation (weather, seasons, disasters)
- [ ] Social evolution (relationships, politics, economics)
- [ ] Emergent world changes
- [ ] Integration with chronicle system

**Definition of Done:** World evolves dynamically with realistic environmental and social changes.

## Phase 5: Integration and Optimization (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 System Integration Testing
**File:** `backend/tests/living_world_integration_tests.rs`

**Problem:** Need comprehensive testing of living world functionality
- Integration between all systems
- Performance under load
- Data consistency validation

**Solution:** Comprehensive integration testing
```rust
#[test]
async fn test_full_living_world_scenario() {
    // Test complete entity lifecycle
    // Test spatial relationships

**Definition of Done:** All living world systems work together seamlessly with high performance.

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
**File:** `backend/src/services/performance_optimizer.rs`

**Problem:** Complex living world systems may impact performance
- Entity queries need optimization
- Spatial calculations need caching
- Autonomous behaviors need scheduling

**Solution:** Performance optimization layer
```rust
pub struct PerformanceOptimizer {
    // Optimize entity queries with caching
    pub async fn optimize_entity_queries() -> Result<()>
    
    // Cache spatial calculations
    pub async fn cache_spatial_relationships() -> Result<()>
    
    // Schedule autonomous behaviors efficiently
    pub async fn optimize_behavior_scheduling() -> Result<()>
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Query optimization with Redis caching
