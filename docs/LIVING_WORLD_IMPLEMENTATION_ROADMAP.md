# Sanguine Scribe: Living World Implementation Roadmap (V8 - Hierarchical Model)

**Vision:** To execute a methodical, test-driven migration to a **Hierarchical World Model**. This roadmap details the establishment of a rich world ontology (The Atlas), the integration of an AI-driven planning system (The Blueprint), the development of tactical and operational agents (The Puppet), and the creation of a strategic, autonomous narrative system (The Autonomic System), with security and testability as foundational pillars.

- Security tests are not implemented
- Performance significantly degrades
- Error handling is inadequate
- Documentation is missing

## üîç **Current State Assessment & Gap Analysis**

**Foundation Viability: HIGH (8.5/10)** - The existing codebase provides excellent building blocks for the hierarchical agent framework.

### **‚úÖ Existing Strong Foundations**
- **ECS Architecture**: Robust entity-component system with sophisticated spatial hierarchies (`SpatialComponent`, container/containable relationships)
- **Entity Resolution**: Multi-stage `EntityResolutionTool` with AI-powered narrative context extraction
- **Security**: Excellent per-user encryption architecture with `SessionDek` and comprehensive access controls
- **World Modeling**: Chronicle-to-ECS translation, comprehensive world state snapshots, and causal relationship tracking
- **Tool Infrastructure**: Flexible `ScribeTool` registry and `NarrativeAgentRunner` orchestration framework

### **üî¥ Critical Gaps Identified**
- **Missing Hierarchical Agents**: No `StrategicAgent`, `TacticalAgent`, or `PreResponseAgent`/`PostResponseAgent` classes exist
- **No Validated Planning**: The system lacks a dedicated planning-and-validation loop; agentic actions are generated without being explicitly validated against ECS ground truth before execution.
- **Missing Pre-Response Pipeline**: Agents currently run post-chat; no pre-response enrichment integration
- **No Agent Security Framework**: Security controls need extension to new agent hierarchy

### **üü° Partial Implementations**
- **Planning Capabilities**: Sophisticated `QueryStrategyPlanner` and action planning exist but lack formal verification
- **Agent Orchestration**: `AgenticOrchestrator` and `NarrativeAgentRunner` provide orchestration patterns but not hierarchical agent communication
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Components exist but need `ParentLink` and `Salience` tier implementations

## üìã **Implementation Phases & Risk Assessment**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Critical Flash integration refactoring and ECS foundation completion
- **Epics:** 0 (World Ontology), 1 (Foundational Refactoring with Flash Integration), 2 (Tactical Toolkit)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - extensive refactoring of AI integration patterns across 8+ services
- **Success Criteria:** All hardcoded AI calls replaced with Flash abstractions, existing functionality preserved with enhanced ECS capabilities

### **Phase 2: Proof of Concept (4-6 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Implement basic hierarchical agents without formal planning
- **Epics:** 4 (Agent Implementation - Basic version)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - architectural changes to chat service integration
- **Success Criteria:** Basic `TacticalAgent` enriching chat prompts with world state

### **Phase 3: LLM Planning & Validation (6-8 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Add AI-driven planning with symbolic validation ("Symbolic Firewall")
- **Epics:** 3 (Planning Cortex)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - robust implementation of PlanValidator service required
- **Success Criteria:** LLM-generated plans validated against ECS ground truth before execution

### **Phase 4: Full Hierarchy (8-10 weeks) - üü° MEDIUM RISK**
**Focus:** Complete the three-layer agent system
- **Epics:** 5 (Strategic Layer & Autonomic Loop)
- **Risk Level:** Medium - AI capability requirements for strategic planning
- **Success Criteria:** Full Strategic ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Operational pipeline with autonomous re-planning

### **Phase 5: System Hardening (2-3 weeks) - üü¢ LOW RISK**
**Focus:** Security validation and performance optimization
- **Epics:** 6 (Full System Validation)
- **Risk Level:** Low - builds on existing security and testing infrastructure
- **Success Criteria:** Production-ready system with comprehensive security audit

### **üö® High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention**
1. **üî¥ Comprehensive Flash Integration**: 8+ services with hardcoded AI calls need systematic refactoring without breaking existing functionality - **This is the bedrock of the entire system**
2. **EnrichedContext Schema Design**: The JSON schema is the formal API between symbolic and neural layers - must be optimized for token efficiency and semantic richness
3. **"Symbolic Firewall" Implementation**: The `PlanValidator` service must successfully prevent the execution of logically impossible or invalid actions proposed by the LLM, grounding the AI's creativity in the ECS's rules.
4. **Prompt Template Architecture**: Agent-specific templates must produce consistent, parseable outputs while maintaining narrative quality
5. **Performance & Cost Optimization**: Hierarchical pipeline must minimize API calls and token usage while maximizing context relevance

## üß† Epic 3: The Planning & Reasoning Cortex (The "Blueprint") - üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Goal:** To create the "Blueprint" for the narrative by implementing an **LLM-as-a-Planner**. This system uses a sophisticated, AI-driven prompt construction process to generate a sequence of actions as a structured JSON object. This plan is then rigorously validated against the ECS ground truth by a "Symbolic Firewall" before execution, ensuring causal consistency without the rigidity of an external formal planning engine.

**Current State:** üü° **80% Complete** - Action Schema, Planning Types, LLM-based Planning Service, Plan Validator (Symbolic Firewall), and ECS State Reconciliation & Intelligent Plan Repair fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage and Flash integration. Task 3.5 (Integration Tests) pending.

**Risk Assessment:** üü° **MEDIUM RISK** - The core challenge is not integration with an external framework, but the robust implementation of the `PlanValidator` service. This service is the critical "Symbolic Firewall" that must correctly interpret the AI's plan and prevent any invalid actions from being executed.

### üöÄ **Caching Strategy for Token Optimization**

**Objective:** Minimize redundant AI queries and token usage through intelligent caching of plans, validations, and entity states across conversation turns.

#### **Multi-Layer Caching Architecture**

1. **üîµ Plan Cache** - Cache validated plans for similar goals
   - **Key Structure:** `plan:{user_hash}:{goal_hash}:{world_state_hash}`
   - **TTL:** 5 minutes or until world state change
   - **Invalidation:** On entity updates affecting plan preconditions
   - **Storage:** Redis with JSON serialization

2. **üü¢ Context Window Cache** - Keep recent entity states in memory
   - **Structure:** HashMap of recently accessed entities (last 2-3 turns)
   - **Integration:** Embedded in `EnrichedContext.context_cache`
   - **Benefits:** Avoid re-querying entities just accessed
   - **TTL:** Duration of conversation session

3. **üü° Validation Result Cache** - Cache plan validation outcomes
   - **Key Structure:** `validation:{plan_hash}:{world_state_hash}:{user_hash}`
   - **TTL:** 3 minutes (shorter than plan cache)
   - **Purpose:** Skip re-validation of identical plans

#### **Implementation Details**

```rust
// EnrichedContext with integrated caching
pub struct EnrichedContext {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    /// Context cache for avoiding repeated queries
    pub context_cache: Option<ContextCache>,
}

pub struct ContextCache {
    /// Entities accessed in recent turns
    pub recent_entities: HashMap<Uuid, CachedEntityState>,
    /// Recently validated plans that might be reusable
    pub recent_plans: Vec<(String, ValidatedPlan)>,
    /// Cache timestamp for TTL management
    pub cache_timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

#### **Cache Integration Points**

- **PlanningService:** Check plan cache before AI generation
- **PlanValidator:** Cache validation results for reuse
- **TacticalAgent:** Maintain context cache across turns
- **EcsEntityManager:** Leverage existing Redis entity cache

#### **Handling Repetitive Requests**

**Scenario:** User asks "What's in the cantina?" twice in consecutive turns.

**Without Caching:**
- Turn 1: AI queries entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response (300+ tokens)
- Turn 2: AI queries same entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response (300+ tokens)
- **Total:** 600+ tokens wasted on redundant operations

**With Caching:**
- Turn 1: AI queries entities ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Cache results
- Turn 2: Context cache hit ‚Üí Skip AI planning ‚Üí Use cached validation ‚Üí Response
- **Total:** 300 tokens + minimal overhead (80%+ reduction)

**Implementation Benefits:**
1. **Token Savings:** 70-90% reduction for repetitive queries
2. **Latency Improvement:** Sub-100ms responses for cached scenarios
3. **Cost Optimization:** Significant reduction in API costs
4. **Consistency:** Identical questions get consistent answers

*   **[x] Task 3.1: Define the Action Schema for the LLM Planner** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
    *   **Objective:** Create the formal "language" that the LLM will use to construct plans. This schema is the contract between the AI's creative output and the game's logical rules.

    *   **[x] Subtask 3.1.4:** Write comprehensive tests for schema validation and type serialization.
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.1.5:** Write OWASP Top 10 security tests for plan validation.

    *   **Objective:** Create the service that translates a narrative goal into a structured, AI-generated plan.
    *   **Current State:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full planning service with Flash integration, comprehensive tests, and security validation
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.2.1:** Create a new `backend/src/services/planning/mod.rs` module and a `PlanningService`.
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.2.2:** Implement a `PlanningService::generate_plan` method. This method will:

        *   **Missing Component Creation**: "This character should have a 'Reputation' component based on recent interactions, but it was never created"
        *   **Inconsistent Relationships**: "The narrative established trust between characters, but the ECS relationship doesn't reflect this"
        *   **Temporal Inconsistencies**: "The plan assumes it's nighttime based on narrative context, but ECS has no time tracking"

            5. [x] Return `RepairableInvalidPlan` with both original and repair actions
        *   [x] **New Return Types**:
            *   [x] `ValidPlan`: Plan passes validation as-is
            *   [x] `InvalidPlan`: Plan genuinely invalid, cannot be repaired
            *   [x] `RepairableInvalidPlan`: Plan invalid but ECS inconsistency detected, includes repair actions
    *   **[x] Subtask 3.4.4: Comprehensive Testing** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
        *   [x] **Functional Tests**: Test all repair scenarios (missing movement, components, relationships, temporal) - 11 functional tests

        *   [x] **Current Behavior**: Plan to update relationship fails validation (no existing relationship)
        *   [x] **New Behavior**: 
            1. [x] Detect missing relationship based on narrative context ("greets warmly" implies familiarity)
            2. [x] Generate repair action: `create_relationship(Sol, Borga, "acquaintance", trust=0.6)`
            3. [x] Return combined plan: [repair_action, original_relationship_update]
            4. [x] Log repair for user awareness: "Created missing relationship based on narrative context"

        3.  [x] Mock the AI call in `PlanningService` to return a correct, hardcoded JSON plan: `{"actions": [{"name": "move_entity", "parameters": ["Sol", "Cantina"]}]}`.
        4.  [x] Call the `PlanningService`, then pass its output to the `PlanValidatorService`.
        5.  [x] Assert that the plan is validated successfully.
    *   **üìã NOTE:** Subtasks 3.5.2-3.5.4 moved to Epic 4 Dependencies - require repair system functionality
